<h1 style="font-size: 1.5em">HTML: The basics of HTML</h1>
<p>
  Every day we look at dozens of web pages and read texts on them that are
  rendered as though they were in a magazine. These pages are hypertext - a
  system of web pages that can be navigated using links. A language, HTML,
  exists to implement this system.
</p>
<p>
  HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. By its function, HTML is a set of
  rules by which the browser distinguishes headings from lists, tables from
  pictures, and so on. HTML appeared in 1993 and was intended to standardize the
  rules for displaying text within web pages.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Even this page is text marked up using HTML and processed by the browser.
  Technology has come a long way, but the concept of using HTML to mark up text
  has remained unchanged for many years.
</p>
<br />
<p>Here is an example of HTML markup:</p>

<pre>
<code>
&lt;section&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;Code Basics&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Code Basics - free hands-on 
   programming lessons for people
   starting from scratch.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   If you are a complete beginner 
   and want to learn the basics - 
   variables, strings, loops, 
   functions, etc., 
   then Code Basics is for you.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Don&#39;t be intimidated by all the confusing words and symbols - by the end
  of the course, you&#39;ll understand how the markup above works, and
  you&#39;ll learn how to use this markup on your own pages. Note that the whole
  essence of the markup above is text. The rest are auxiliary elements to
  display the text where it was conceived to be by the designers and/or
  developers.
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<br />
<p>Copy the HTML and paste it into the editor on this page</p>
<pre>
      <code>
&lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;
      </code>
    </pre>
