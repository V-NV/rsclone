<h1>HTML: Paragraphs</h1>
<p>
  Paragraphs are the main way to divide a large text into small logical blocks.
  These blocks are automatically &quot;indented&quot; from each other. Such text
  is much easier to read and does not scare users.
</p>

<p>
  Paragraphs are mostly found within large text. For example, any lesson on
  Hexlet or Code Basics is broken up into paragraphs for easy reading, just like
  this one.
</p>

<p>
  t is broken down into small blocks of meaning. Not only is it more comfortable
  to read, but you can quickly find the information you need in a large text.
</p>

<p>
  Paragraphs are created using the paired <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag with a
  small amount of text in the body. For example:
</p>
<br>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;First paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Second paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
  </code></pre>

<p>This is what they look like in the browser:</p>

<div>
  <p>First paragraph</p>
  <p>Second paragraph</p>
</div>
<br>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<br>
<p>Wrap the phrase <em style="color:#3497ee;">Hello, World</em> in a paragraph tag</p>
