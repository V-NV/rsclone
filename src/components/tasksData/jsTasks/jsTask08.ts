  <p>A binary operation is commutative since swapping operands gets you the same result. Obviously, addition is a commutative operation: <em>3 + 2 = 2 + 3</em>.</p>
  
  <p>But is subtraction a commutative operation? Of course not: <em>2 - 3 â‰  3 - 2</em>. In programming, this law applies just like it does in arithmetic.</p>
  
  <p>Moreover, most of the operations we face in real life are not commutative. Here is the conclusion: always pay attention to the order of things you work with.</p>
  <h2>Instructions</h2><p>Write a program that adds and prints the values of &quot;3 to the power of 5&quot; and &quot;-8 divided by -4&quot;.</p>
