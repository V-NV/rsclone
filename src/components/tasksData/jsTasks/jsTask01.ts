const jsTask01 = `
</li></ol></nav><div><h1>JavaScript: Hello, World!</h1><p>As is tradition, we&#39;ll start by writing a &#39;Hello, World!&#39; program. The program will print the following text:</p>

    <pre>
      Hello, World!
    </pre>
    
    <p>To print something, you need to give computer a special command. In JavaScript, we use <code>console.log()</code>.</p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2><p>Copy the exact code from the instructions into the editor and run it by clicking “Run”.</p>
    
    <pre><code>console.log(&#39;Hello, World!&#39;);
    </code></pre>
    
    <p>Note that if you type <code>hello, woRld!</code> instead of <code>Hello, World!</code>, it will count as different text, because upper and lowercase letters are different symbols in JavaScript. Letter size is called <em>case</em>, and any programmer will tell you that <em>case is important</em>. This rule affects almost everything in coding, so make sure you get used to paying close attention to the case at all times.</p>
